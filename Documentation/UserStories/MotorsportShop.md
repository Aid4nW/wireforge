# Persona: The Motorsport Shop

## Who They Are
This user works for or runs a professional motorsport preparation shop or a race team. They build wiring harnesses for vehicles that compete in high-stakes environments like circuit racing, rally, drifting, or endurance events. For them, wiring is not just about functionality; it's a critical performance and reliability component where failure is not an option.

## Overall Goals
*   **Achieve Flawless Reliability:** Their absolute top priority is to design and build harnesses that can withstand extreme vibration, heat, and moisture without a single point of failure during a race.
*   **Optimize for Performance:** They need to create harnesses that are as lightweight and compact as possible, without compromising strength or serviceability.
*   **Implement Rigorous Quality Control:** Their process requires stringent checks and balances. They need to generate detailed reports, perform continuity and load testing, and ensure every connection is perfect.
*   **Produce Professional-Grade Documentation:** They require comprehensive documentation, including detailed schematics, pin-to-pin wire lists, and visual layout diagrams that are accurate enough for post-race analysis and rapid trackside repairs.
*   **Utilize Advanced Materials and Techniques:** They work with top-of-the-line components like Deutsch Autosport connectors, PDM (Power Distribution Module) systems, and military-spec (milspec) wire and sheathing.

## Skill Level
*   **Electrical Knowledge:** Elite. They are experts in advanced automotive electronics, including complex data acquisition systems, CAN bus network topology, and strategies for mitigating electromagnetic interference (EMI).
*   **Software Proficiency:** High. They are often power users of design software and expect precision, control, and powerful features. They may be looking for an alternative to expensive enterprise eCAD software that is more focused and efficient for their specific workflow.
*   **Fabrication Skills:** Master craftsperson. They are experts in techniques like concentric twisting, proper strain relief, and sealing connections to aerospace standards. Their work is as much an art form as it is an engineering discipline.

## User Stories
*   As a motorsport engineer, I want to design harnesses with complex features like concentric twisting and service loops, so that I can build harnesses to the highest professional standards.
*   As a motorsport engineer, I want to run validation checks on my design to automatically flag potential issues, such as a wire gauge being too small for a given current load, so that I can prevent critical failures.
*   As a motorsport engineer, I want to generate a complete bill of materials (BOM) with exact part numbers, including wires, connectors, and heat shrink, so that I can streamline our purchasing and inventory management.
