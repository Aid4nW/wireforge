Persona: The DIY Hobbyist
##########################

Who They Are
============
The DIY Hobbyist is a passionate car enthusiast who loves getting their hands dirty. They work on their own vehicles in a home garage, tackling projects that range from simple modifications to full-scale restorations or complex engine swaps. They might be restoring a classic muscle car, building a track-day weapon, or converting a vehicle to electric power. Their budget is often limited, and they rely on community forums, YouTube tutorials, and their own ingenuity to solve problems.

Overall Goals
=============
*   **Create a Safe and Reliable Harness:** Their primary goal is to build a custom wiring harness that is functional, safe, and won't leave them stranded.
*   **Stay on Budget:** They want to avoid the high costs associated with professional-grade software or paying a specialist to design and build the harness.
*   **Learn and Accomplish:** A major motivator is the satisfaction of learning a new skill and successfully completing a complex part of their project themselves.
*   **Keep it Simple:** They need a tool that is intuitive and doesn't require a steep learning curve to get started.

Skill Level
===========
*   **Electrical Knowledge:** Varies widely from beginner to advanced. Some may only know basic 12V theory, while others might have a solid understanding of automotive electronics, including CAN bus systems.
*   **Software Proficiency:** Generally not a software expert. They are comfortable with standard computer use but are not power users of CAD or complex design software. They value visual, drag-and-drop style interfaces over command-line or script-based tools.
*   **Fabrication Skills:** Often possesses good mechanical and fabrication skills, but the quality of their wiring work can range from messy to meticulous.

User Stories
============
*   As a DIY hobbyist, I want to visually drag and drop components onto a canvas, so that I can easily lay out my wiring without needing to understand complex CAD software.
*   As a DIY hobbyist, I want to select from a pre-populated library of common automotive connectors and sensors, so that I don't have to manually draw parts I'm using.
*   As a DIY hobbyist, I want the software to automatically calculate the total length of each wire, so that I know how much wire to buy for my project.
