Persona: The Engineering Student
################################

Who They Are
============
The Engineering Student is typically part of a university team competing in events like Formula SAE, Baja SAE, Solar Car Challenge, or similar engineering competitions. They are bright, motivated, and working in a team environment under tight deadlines and strict rules.

Overall Goals
=============
*   **Design a Competitive System:** Their main objective is to design a lightweight, robust, and rules-compliant wiring harness for their team's vehicle.
*   **Apply Theoretical Knowledge:** They want to bridge the gap between classroom theory (circuit analysis, signal processing) and real-world application.
*   **Collaborate Effectively:** They need to work with other team members, sharing design files and documentation seamlessly.
*   **Learn and Innovate:** They are eager to learn industry-standard practices and often look for innovative solutions to gain a competitive edge.

Skill Level
===========
*   **Electrical Knowledge:** Strong theoretical foundation in electrical and electronic engineering principles. However, they may lack the practical, hands-on experience of a seasoned technician.
*   **Software Proficiency:** Highly proficient with a wide range of software, including CAD, simulation tools (like SPICE), and programming (C++, Python). They are quick to learn new software and are not intimidated by complex interfaces.
*   **Teamwork:** Accustomed to working in a collaborative, project-based environment. Version control and clear documentation are important concepts for them.

User Stories
============
*   As an engineering student, I want to collaborate with my teammates on the same harness design, so that we can work together efficiently and keep our project in sync.
*   As an engineering student, I want to export my design to a format that can be used for a design report or presentation, so that I can easily share our work with judges and professors.
*   As an engineering student, I want to be able to define and analyze CAN bus networks, so that I can design and document the communication systems in our vehicle.
