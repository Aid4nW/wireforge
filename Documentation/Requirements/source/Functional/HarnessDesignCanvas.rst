   Users must be able to visually drag and drop components onto a design canvas.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**
   *   A library of components is visible.
   *   Users can select a component from the library and place it on the canvas.
   *   Components on the canvas can be moved to new positions.

   Users must be able to draw wires to create logical connections between component pins.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**
   *   Users can select a pin on a component to start a connection.
   *   Users can draw a line to a pin on another (or the same) component to complete a connection.
   *   The system visually represents the wire connecting the two pins.

.. freq:: Advanced Harness Features

   The system must support the design of advanced harness features like service loops and concentric twisting.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**
   *   Users can add properties to wires or groups of wires to specify a service loop.
   *   Users can define a set of wires to be concentrically twisted.
   *   The visual representation and data model reflect these advanced features for manufacturing outputs.
