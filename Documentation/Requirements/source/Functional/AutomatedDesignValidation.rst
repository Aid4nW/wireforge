   The system must provide automated checks to validate the design against configurable rules (e.g., wire gauge vs. current load, voltage drop).

   **Acceptance Criteria:**
   *   The system can identify and flag wires with insufficient gauge for their current load.
   *   The system can identify and flag excessive voltage drop across wires.
   *   Users can configure custom design rules.
   *   Validation results are presented clearly to the user.
