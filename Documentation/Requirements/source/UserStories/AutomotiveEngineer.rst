Persona: The Automotive Engineer
##############################

Who They Are
============
The Automotive Engineer works in a professional setting, often for an OEM, Tier 1 supplier, or an engineering consultancy. They are involved in the design, development, and validation of vehicle electrical systems. Their work requires precision, adherence to industry standards (e.g., ISO 26262, SAE J1939), and robust documentation. They often collaborate with cross-functional teams and may work on multiple projects simultaneously. They are familiar with professional CAD and CAE tools.

Overall Goals
=============
*   **Ensure Functional Safety:** Their paramount concern is designing wiring harnesses that meet stringent functional safety requirements and prevent hazards.
*   **Optimize for Manufacturability and Cost:** They aim to design harnesses that are efficient to produce, minimize material waste, and reduce overall vehicle cost.
*   **Integrate with Existing Systems:** The design must seamlessly integrate with other vehicle systems (e.g., ECUs, sensors, actuators) and communication networks (e.g., CAN, LIN, Ethernet).
*   **Maintain Traceability and Documentation:** They require comprehensive documentation and traceability from requirements to design, testing, and validation.
*   **Facilitate Collaboration:** The tool must support multi-user collaboration and version control for complex projects.

Skill Level
===========
*   **Electrical Knowledge:** Expert-level understanding of automotive electrical systems, including power distribution, signal integrity, EMC, and network protocols.
*   **Software Proficiency:** Highly proficient with professional engineering software, including ECAD tools, simulation software, and PLM systems. They expect advanced features and customization options.
*   **Industry Standards:** Deep knowledge and application of relevant automotive industry standards and regulations.
