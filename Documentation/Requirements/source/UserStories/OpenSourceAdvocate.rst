Persona: The Open-Source Advocate
##############################

Who They Are
============
This user is a software developer, hardware engineer, or tech enthusiast who is a strong believer in the principles of free and open-source software (FOSS). They choose their tools based on philosophy as much as functionality.

Overall Goals
=============
*   **Use a FOSS Tool:** Their primary requirement is that the tool is open-source, allowing them the freedom to use, inspect, modify, and distribute it.
*   **Avoid Vendor Lock-in:** They want to use open data formats for their designs so they are not tied to a proprietary ecosystem.
*   **Contribute and Improve:** They may have the desire and ability to contribute back to the project, whether by fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation.
*   **Extensibility:** They value the ability to script, automate, or extend the tool's functionality to fit their specific workflow, for example, through plugins or APIs.

Skill Level
===========
*   **Electrical Knowledge:** Can range from hobbyist-level to professional electrical engineer. Their defining characteristic is their software and systems expertise.
*   **Software Proficiency:** Expert. They are very comfortable with software development practices, version control systems like Git, and are not afraid to dive into the source code to understand how something works.
*   **Systems Thinking:** They think about the entire ecosystem of a project, including its community, its development practices, and its long-term sustainability.

User Stories
============

.. story:: As an open-source advocate, I want the harness design files to be saved in a human-readable, non-proprietary format (like JSON or XML), so that I can easily version control them and write my own scripts to manipulate them.

.. story:: As an open-source advocate, I want the application to expose a plugin API, so that I can extend the tool's functionality to meet my specific needs.

.. story:: As an open-source advocate, I want to be able to self-host the entire application and its backend, so that I have full control over my data and the software I use.
