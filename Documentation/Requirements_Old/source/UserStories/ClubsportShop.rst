Who They Are
============
This user owns or works at a performance-focused shop that specializes in preparing cars for track days, club racing (like SCCA or NASA), and amateur-level drifting or rally events. They bridge the gap between a general custom shop and a full-blown professional motorsport team. Their clients are serious enthusiasts who demand reliable and robust solutions for their track vehicles.

Overall Goals
=============
*   **Deliver Track-Ready Reliability:** Their primary goal is to build harnesses that can withstand the rigors of track use—higher heat, more vibration, and greater stress than street driving—to ensure their clients' cars are safe and dependable.
*   **Balance Performance and Budget:** They need to provide high-quality, performance-oriented solutions (like PDM conversions, sensor additions, and ECU wiring) while remaining mindful of the amateur racer's budget, which is typically tighter than a pro team's.
*   **Standardize and Streamline:** They aim to develop standardized, repeatable wiring packages for popular club racing platforms (e.g., Miata, E36, BRZ) to improve efficiency and ensure consistent quality across builds.
*   **Produce Clear, Serviceable Documentation:** They need to create documentation that is clear enough for their own technicians to build from and for their clients to use for trackside diagnosis and maintenance.

Skill Level
===========
*   **Electrical Knowledge:** High. They have strong practical and theoretical knowledge of vehicle electronics, including standalone ECU installation, data acquisition setup, and best practices for routing and securing harnesses in a race car chassis.
*   **Software Proficiency:** Proficient. They are comfortable with design software but need a tool that is fast, intuitive, and focused on the specific demands of motorsport wiring without the steep learning curve or cost of high-end enterprise eCAD systems.
*   **Fabrication Skills:** Excellent. They are skilled in building durable harnesses, often using techniques and materials a step above standard road cars, such as DR-25 sheathing and Deutsch connectors, but perhaps not to the full milspec level of a top-tier motorsport team.

User Stories

.. story:: As a clubsport shop owner, I want to define specific wire specifications (type, gauge, color) for different systems (e.g., power, ground, signal, data), so that I can ensure we are using the correct wire for every application.
