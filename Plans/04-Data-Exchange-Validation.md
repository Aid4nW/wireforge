# Phase 3: Data Exchange & Validation

This phase focuses on implementing robust data exchange capabilities and automated design validation to ensure design quality and interoperability.

## Core Technologies

- **Frontend:** We will continue using Next.js and React. The following libraries will be added:
    - **XML Parsing:** A library to handle parsing and generating industry-standard formats like KBL.

## Architecture

- **Data Exchange Modules:** Dedicated modules will be developed for handling the import and export of various industry-standard data formats.
- **Validation Engine:** A rules engine will be implemented to perform automated design checks based on configurable criteria.

## Fulfilled Requirements

This phase will address the following key requirements:

### Functional Requirements
- **REQ-FUNC-XIM-001 (Industry Standard Data Exchange):** Support for importing and exporting designs in industry-standard formats.
- **REQ-FUNC-VAL-001 (Automated Design Validation):** Automated checks for design rules.

### Product Requirements
- **REQ-PROD-AE-001 (Functional Safety Assurance):** Adding design rule checks (DRCs) and validation features.
- **REQ-PROD-AE-002 (Manufacturability and Cost Optimization):** Advanced BOM and design features support this.
- **REQ-PROD-AE-003 (System Integration):** Supporting industry-standard import/export formats.
- **REQ-PROD-AE-004 (Traceability and Documentation):** Generating professional-grade documentation.
- **REQ-PROD-CRS-003 (Error Reduction):** Validation features and clear documentation help reduce errors.
- **REQ-PROD-MS-003 (Rigorous Quality Control):** Generating reports for testing and validation.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- **KBL Generation:** Write tests to ensure the output format and content are correct for generated KBL files.
- **Design Validation Logic:** Test the rules engine and flagging mechanisms for automated design validation.

### 2. Product Level Tests (End-to-End)
- **Import/Export Workflow:** Create a test to import a design from a KBL file, make a modification, and export it again, asserting the data is handled correctly.
- **Design Validation Workflow:** Create a test that intentionally creates a design with a known design rule violation and asserts that the validation system correctly flags it.
