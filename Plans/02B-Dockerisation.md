## Revised Dockerization Plan: Frontend Only

1.  **Create `frontend/Dockerfile`:** This Dockerfile will be placed inside the existing `frontend/` directory and will build the Next.js application image.
2.  **Update `docker-compose.yml`:** I will create this file in the project root. It will define a single service:
    *   `frontend`: Builds and runs the Next.js application, mapping port 3000.

## Instructions for Usage

To build and run the Dockerized frontend application:

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker compose build
    ```
2.  **Run the Dockerized application (in detached mode):**
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

To stop the Dockerized application:

1.  **Stop the running containers:**
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

**Expected Outcome:**
After this plan is executed, you will have a Dockerized WireForge frontend application that can be easily spun up and managed using Docker Compose. You can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
