# Phase 4: Extensibility and Open Source

This final phase focuses on maximizing the project's reach and utility by empowering the community. The goal is to make WireForge not just a tool, but a platform that others can build upon, integrate with, and contribute to.

## Core Technologies

- **Backend:** The FastAPI backend will be extended to support a plugin architecture and a public API.
- **Frontend:** The React frontend will be made more modular to allow for the integration of plugins.
- **Documentation:** We will use a documentation generator like **Sphinx** (which is already in use for requirements) or **MkDocs** to create comprehensive developer and API documentation.

## Architecture

- **Public API:** A versioned, stable, and well-documented public API will be created. This will allow third-party applications to interact with WireForge data (with user permission).
- **Plugin System:** A plugin system will be designed for both the frontend and backend. This will allow the community to add new functionality, such as:
    - Support for new import/export formats.
    - Custom design rule checks (DRCs).
    - Integrations with other tools (e.g., inventory management, project management).
- **Data Formats:** We will ensure that the primary data format for harness designs is fully open and documented (e.g., JSON Schema), allowing users to easily read, write, and manipulate their data with external scripts.
- **Self-Hosting Documentation:** Comprehensive guides will be created to instruct users on how to deploy their own instance of the entire WireForge stack (frontend, backend, database) using tools like Docker.

## Fulfilled Requirements

This phase will address the following key requirements:

### Product Requirements
- **REQ-PROD-OSA-001 (FOSS Tool Utilization):** The entire stack is open-source.
- **REQ-PROD-OSA-002 (Vendor Lock-in Avoidance):** Achieved through open data formats.
- **REQ-PROD-OSA-003 (Contribution and Improvement):** The plugin system and open-source nature facilitate this.
- **REQ-PROD-OSA-004 (Extensibility Support):** The public API and plugin architecture directly address this.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- **API Versioning and Stability:** Write tests to ensure that changes to the API do not break existing contracts.
- **Plugin Host Logic:** Test the core logic that discovers, loads, and interacts with plugins on both the frontend and backend.
- **Data Format Validation:** Create tests that validate designs against the official JSON schema to ensure data integrity.

### 2. Product Level Tests (End-to-End)
- **Public API Workflow:** Write tests that use the public API to create a design, modify it, and retrieve it, all without interacting with the UI.
- **Plugin Installation and Usage:** Create a test that installs a sample plugin and then verifies that the functionality provided by the plugin works as expected within the application.
- **Self-Hosting Deployment:** While difficult to fully automate in a CI/CD pipeline, we will create a manual test plan to be run before each release. This involves following the self-hosting documentation from scratch to deploy a full instance of WireForge and running a basic set of smoke tests to ensure it is functional.
