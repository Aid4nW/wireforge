# Phase 2: Professional Features

This phase builds upon the MVP foundation to add features required by professional shops, engineers, and serious hobbyists. The focus is on enabling more complex designs, improving documentation, and supporting custom workflows.

## Core Technologies

- **Frontend:** We will continue using Next.js and React. The following libraries will be added:
    - **PDF Generation:** A library like `jspdf` or `@react-pdf/renderer` to enable professional PDF exports for the Bill of Materials.
    - **XML Parsing:** A library to handle parsing and generating industry-standard formats like KBL.
- **State Management:** As complexity increases, we may evaluate graduating from React's built-in state hooks to a more robust solution like **Zustand** or **Redux Toolkit** to manage the application state.

## Architecture

- **Advanced Data Model:** The core data structure for harness designs will be extended to support advanced features like service loops, concentric twisting, and custom properties for wires and components.
- **Custom Library Management:** A new section of the application will be developed for users to create, edit, and manage their own library of custom components. This will still leverage local storage in this phase.
- **BOM Customization UI:** A new modal or dedicated page will be created to allow users to configure BOM templates, selecting columns and adding custom branding before export.

## Fulfilled Requirements

This phase will address the following key requirements:

### Functional Requirements
- **REQ-FUNC-CAN-003 (Advanced Harness Features):** Support for service loops and concentric twisting.
- **REQ-FUNC-LIB-002 (Custom Component Creation):** Users will be able to create and save their own components.
- **REQ-FUNC-BOM-002 (Customizable BOM Templates):** Users will be able to customize BOM content and appearance.
- **(Implied) Import/Export:** Functionality to handle formats like KBL, satisfying `STORY-AE-002`.
- **REQ-FUNC-XIM-001 (Industry Standard Data Exchange):** Support for importing and exporting designs in industry-standard formats.
- **REQ-FUNC-VAL-001 (Automated Design Validation):** Automated checks for design rules.

### Product Requirements
- **REQ-PROD-AE-001 (Functional Safety Assurance):** Adding design rule checks (DRCs) and validation features.
- **REQ-PROD-AE-002 (Manufacturability and Cost Optimization):** Advanced BOM and design features support this.
- **REQ-PROD-AE-003 (System Integration):** Supporting industry-standard import/export formats.

- **REQ-PROD-CS-001 (Track-Ready Reliability):** Advanced harness features enable more robust designs.
- **REQ-PROD-CS-002 (Performance and Budget Balance):** Design optimization features support this.
- **REQ-PROD-CS-003 (Standardization and Streamlining):** Custom libraries and templates enable standardization.
- **REQ-PROD-CS-004 (Clear, Serviceable Documentation):** Professional BOM and PDF exports.
- **REQ-PROD-CRS-001 (Efficiency and Repeatability):** Achieved via custom libraries and templates.
- **REQ-PROD-CRS-002 (Professional Documentation Generation):** A core focus of this phase.
- **REQ-PROD-CRS-003 (Error Reduction):** Validation features and clear documentation help reduce errors.
- **REQ-PROD-CRS-004 (Complexity Management):** Advanced canvas features are key to managing complexity.
- **REQ-PROD-MS-001, REQ-PROD-MS-005 (Motorsport):** Support for advanced materials and techniques.
- **REQ-PROD-MS-002 (Performance Optimization):** Features to design lightweight and compact harnesses.
- **REQ-PROD-MS-003 (Rigorous Quality Control):** Generating reports for testing and validation.
- **REQ-PROD-MS-004 (Professional-Grade Documentation):** A core focus of this phase.
- **REQ-PROD-ES-001 (Competitive System Design):** Advanced features are necessary for competitive designs.
- **REQ-PROD-ES-004 (Learning and Innovation Support):** Access to professional-grade features supports innovation.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Advanced Canvas Logic:** Test the state management and validation for new features like concentric twisting.
- **PDF/KBL Generation:** Write tests to ensure the output format and content are correct for generated PDF and KBL files.
- **Custom Library Logic:** Test the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the custom component library.
- **Design Validation Logic:** Test the rules engine and flagging mechanisms for automated design validation.

### 2. Product Level Tests (End-to-End)
- **Advanced Harness Design Workflow:** Create a test that designs a harness using service loops, custom components, and exports a professional PDF BOM.
- **Custom Component Workflow:** Write a test to create a new component, save it to the user's library, and then use it in a design.
- **Import/Export Workflow:** Create a test to import a design from a KBL file, make a modification, and export it again, asserting the data is handled correctly.
- **Design Validation Workflow:** Create a test that intentionally creates a design with a known design rule violation and asserts that the validation system correctly flags it.
