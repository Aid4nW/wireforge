# Requirements Planning for WireForge

This document outlines the approach for defining, structuring, and managing requirements for the WireForge project.

## 1. Requirements Categories

We will categorize requirements into three main types:

*   **Product Requirements:** High-level goals, vision, and overall features of the WireForge application. These define *what* the product aims to achieve from a business and user perspective.
*   **Functional Requirements:** Specific behaviors and functionalities the system must perform. These describe *what* the system does.
*   **Non-functional Requirements:** Quality attributes of the system, such as performance, security, usability, scalability, and maintainability. These describe *how well* the system performs its functions.

## 2. Requirements Process

1.  **User Stories (Input):** User needs are captured as user stories in the `Documentation/Requirements/source/UserStories` directory. These serve as the primary input for defining requirements and are now defined using `story` directives within reStructuredText files.
2.  **Requirement Definition:** User stories are translated into detailed requirements, documented in the `Documentation/Requirements` directory.
3.  **Traceability:** Each requirement will ideally trace back to one or more user stories, ensuring that all development is driven by user needs.
4.  **Verification:** Requirements will include acceptance criteria to facilitate testing and verification.

## 3. Requirements Structure and File Organization

Requirements will be organized within the `Documentation/Requirements` directory using a feature-area or logical-module based approach.

### Directory Structure:

*   `Documentation/Requirements/`
    *   `Product/`
        *   `ProductVision.rst`
        *   `CoreFeaturesOverview.rst`
        *   ... (other high-level product documents)
    *   `Functional/`
        *   `UserAuthentication.rst` (e.g., login, registration, password reset)
        *   `HarnessDesignCanvas.rst` (e.g., drag-and-drop, component placement, routing)
        *   `ComponentLibraryManagement.rst` (e.g., creating, editing, searching components)
        *   `BOMGeneration.rst` (e.g., generating bills of materials)
        *   `ExportImport.rst` (e.g., various export/import formats)
        *   `CollaborationFeatures.rst` (if applicable)
        *   ... (other feature-specific functional requirements)
    *   `NonFunctional/`
        *   `Performance.rst` (e.g., response times, load handling)
        *   `Security.rst` (e.g., data encryption, access control)
        *   `Usability.rst` (e.g., UI consistency, accessibility)
        *   `Scalability.rst`
        *   `Maintainability.rst`
        *   ... (other cross-cutting non-functional requirements)
    *   `UserStories/`
        *   `AutomotiveEngineer.rst`
        *   `ClubsportShop.rst`
        *   ... (other user story documents)

### Content of a Requirement File:

Each requirement file (e.g., reStructuredText) will contain:

*   **Unique ID:** Essential for Sphinx-needs tracing (e.g., `REQ-FUNC-AUTH-001`).
*   **Title/Name:** A clear, concise description of the requirement.
*   **Description:** Detailed explanation of the requirement.
*   **Priority:** (e.g., High, Medium, Low)
*   **Status:** (e.g., Draft, Approved, Implemented, Verified)
*   **Origin/Traceability:** Link back to the user story/stories it addresses.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** How the requirement will be verified.

### Example Requirement (using reStructuredText):

```rst
.. freq:: User Login
   :id: REQ-FUNC-AUTH-001
   :status: Approved
   :priority: High
   :tags: security, login
   :links: STORY-DIY-001, STORY-CS-001

   As a user, I must be able to log in to the WireForge application using a valid username and password.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**
   *   Given a registered user, when they enter correct credentials, then they are successfully logged in.
   *   Given a registered user, when they enter incorrect credentials, then an error message is displayed and they remain on the login page.
   *   The system must protect user passwords using industry-standard hashing algorithms.
```
