# Phase 5: Collaboration & Advanced Cloud

This phase builds upon the core cloud infrastructure to enable multi-user collaboration and advanced data management features.

## Core Technologies

- **Backend:** FastAPI will be extended to handle real-time collaboration and versioning.
- **Frontend:** Next.js and React will implement the UI for sharing and version history.

## Architecture

- **Sharing and Access Control:** API endpoints and database schema will be extended to manage sharing permissions and access levels for designs.
- **Version Control System:** A system for tracking changes to designs and maintaining a history of revisions will be implemented.

## Fulfilled Requirements

This phase will address the following key requirements:

### Functional Requirements
- **REQ-FUNC-COL-001 (Collaboration Features):** The core functionality for sharing designs and tracking changes will be implemented.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **REQ-NON-USA-002 (Accessibility):** Ensuring the application is usable by people with disabilities, which is important for educational and public use.

### Product Requirements
- **REQ-PROD-AE-005 (Automotive Engineer):** Support for multi-user collaboration.
- **REQ-PROD-ES-003 (Engineering Student):** Facilitating collaboration among team members.
- **REQ-PROD-EDU-004 (Educator):** Enabling students to share work with instructors.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Sharing Logic:** Test the logic for granting and revoking access to designs.
- **Versioning Logic:** Test the system's ability to create and retrieve different versions of a design.

### 2. Product Level Tests (End-to-End)
- **Sharing Workflow:**
    1.  User A creates a design.
    2.  User A shares the design with User B.
    3.  User B logs in and verifies they can see and access the design.
    4.  User A revokes access, and User B can no longer see the design.
- **Version History Workflow:**
    1.  User creates a design and saves it.
    2.  User makes changes and saves a new version.
    3.  User can view and revert to previous versions.
