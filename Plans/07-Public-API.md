# Phase 6: Public API

This phase focuses on exposing a well-documented and stable public API to allow third-party applications to interact with WireForge data.

## Core Technologies

- **Backend:** The FastAPI backend will be extended to support a public API.
- **Documentation:** We will use a documentation generator like **Sphinx** or **MkDocs** to create comprehensive API documentation.

## Architecture

- **Public API Endpoints:** A versioned, stable, and well-documented set of API endpoints will be created. This will allow third-party applications to interact with WireForge data (with user permission).

## Fulfilled Requirements

This phase will address the following key requirements:

### Product Requirements
- **REQ-PROD-OSA-004 (Extensibility Support):** The public API directly addresses this.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- **API Versioning and Stability:** Write tests to ensure that changes to the API do not break existing contracts.

### 2. Product Level Tests (End-to-End)
- **Public API Workflow:** Write tests that use the public API to create a design, modify it, and retrieve it, all without interacting with the UI.
