# Phase 7: Plugin System

This phase focuses on developing a robust plugin system for both the frontend and backend, allowing the community to extend WireForge's functionality.

## Core Technologies

- **Backend:** The FastAPI backend will be extended to support a plugin architecture.
- **Frontend:** The React frontend will be made more modular to allow for the integration of plugins.

## Architecture

- **Plugin System:** A plugin system will be designed for both the frontend and backend. This will allow the community to add new functionality, such as:
    - Support for new import/export formats.
    - Custom design rule checks (DRCs).
    - Integrations with other tools (e.g., inventory management, project management).

## Fulfilled Requirements

This phase will address the following key requirements:

### Product Requirements
- **REQ-PROD-OSA-003 (Contribution and Improvement):** The plugin system facilitates this.
- **REQ-PROD-OSA-004 (Extensibility Support):** The plugin architecture directly addresses this.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Plugin Host Logic:** Test the core logic that discovers, loads, and interacts with plugins on both the frontend and backend.

### 2. Product Level Tests (End-to-End)
- **Plugin Installation and Usage:** Create a test that installs a sample plugin and then verifies that the functionality provided by the plugin works as expected within the application.
