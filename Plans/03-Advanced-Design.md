# Phase 2: Advanced Design & Documentation

This phase builds upon the MVP foundation to add features required by professional shops, engineers, and serious hobbyists, focusing on enabling more complex designs and improving documentation.

## Core Technologies

- **Frontend:** We will continue using Next.js and React. The following libraries will be added:
    - **PDF Generation:** A library like `jspdf` or `@react-pdf/renderer` to enable professional PDF exports for the Bill of Materials.
- **State Management:** As complexity increases, we may evaluate graduating from React's built-in state hooks to a more robust solution like **Zustand** or **Redux Toolkit** to manage the application state.

## Architecture

- **Advanced Data Model:** The core data structure for harness designs will be extended to support advanced features like service loops and concentric twisting, and custom properties for wires and components.
- **Custom Library Management:** A new section of the application will be developed for users to create, edit, and manage their own library of custom components. This will still leverage local storage in this phase.
- **BOM Customization UI:** A new modal or dedicated page will be created to allow users to configure BOM templates, selecting columns and adding custom branding before export.

## Fulfilled Requirements

This phase will address the following key requirements:

### Functional Requirements
- **REQ-FUNC-CAN-003 (Advanced Harness Features):** Support for service loops and concentric twisting.
- **REQ-FUNC-LIB-002 (Custom Component Creation):** Users will be able to create and save their own components.
- **REQ-FUNC-BOM-002 (Customizable BOM Templates):** Users will be able to customize BOM content and appearance.

### Product Requirements
- **REQ-PROD-CS-001 (Track-Ready Reliability):** Advanced harness features enable more robust designs.
- **REQ-PROD-CS-002 (Performance and Budget Balance):** Design optimization features support this.
- **REQ-PROD-CS-003 (Standardization and Streamlining):** Custom libraries and templates enable standardization.
- **REQ-PROD-CS-004 (Clear, Serviceable Documentation):** Professional BOM and PDF exports.
- **REQ-PROD-CRS-001 (Efficiency and Repeatability):** Achieved via custom libraries and templates.
- **REQ-PROD-CRS-002 (Professional Documentation Generation):** A core focus of this phase.
- **REQ-PROD-CRS-004 (Complexity Management):** Advanced canvas features are key to managing complexity.
- **REQ-PROD-MS-001, REQ-PROD-MS-005 (Motorsport):** Support for advanced materials and techniques.
- **REQ-PROD-MS-002 (Performance Optimization):** Features to design lightweight and compact harnesses.
- **REQ-PROD-MS-004 (Professional-Grade Documentation):** A core focus of this phase.
- **REQ-PROD-ES-001 (Competitive System Design):** Advanced features are necessary for competitive designs.
- **REQ-PROD-ES-004 (Learning and Innovation Support):** Access to professional-grade features supports innovation.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Advanced Canvas Logic:** Test the state management and validation for new features like concentric twisting.
- **PDF Generation:** Write tests to ensure the output format and content are correct for generated PDF files.
- **Custom Library Logic:** Test the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the custom component library.

### 2. Product Level Tests (End-to-End)
- **Advanced Harness Design Workflow:** Create a test that designs a harness using service loops, custom components, and exports a professional PDF BOM.
- **Custom Component Workflow:** Write a test to create a new component, save it to the user's library, and then use it in a design.
